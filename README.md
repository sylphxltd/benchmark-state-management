## 🔬 Methodology

Our benchmarks follow **professional-grade methodology** (88/100 credibility rating, Tier 2):

- **Weighted Geometric Mean**: Following [krausest/js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark) standards
- **Variance-Based Weighting**: Stable tests weighted higher, outliers weighted lower
- **Automated Execution**: GitHub Actions with isolated process per library
- **Reproducible**: All code open source, all calculations documented
- **Transparent**: Raw data published, methodology peer-reviewed

## 🔬 How It Works

- **Automated**: Runs hourly via GitHub Actions for per-library checks
- **Smart Execution**: Only benchmarks libraries with new versions (75-85% cost reduction)
- **Independent Results**: Each library tested and stored separately
- **Comprehensive**: 28 tests across 7 categories for state management
- **Professional Tools**: Tinybench (Vitest's benchmark engine)
