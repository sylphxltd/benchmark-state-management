# Router Benchmark 🏆

Professional performance comparison of JavaScript routing libraries.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This benchmark category is currently under development. Full benchmarks will be available soon.

## 📋 Status

- **Status:** 🚧 In Development
- **Libraries Planned:** 3+
- **Test Categories:** Coming Soon

## 📦 Libraries to Benchmark

- [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) - The most popular React routing library
- [TanStack Router](https://github.com/TanStack/router) - Type-safe routing with built-in data loading
- [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) - Minimalist router for React
- [@sylphx/zen-router](https://github.com/sylphxltd/zen-router) *(coming soon)* - Ultra-fast routing solution

## 🎯 Planned Test Scenarios

- **Route Matching** - Path matching and parameter extraction performance
- **Navigation Performance** - Transition speed between routes
- **Nested Routes** - Deep route hierarchy handling
- **Large Route Trees** - Performance with hundreds of routes
- **Dynamic Imports** - Code splitting and lazy loading

## 🚀 Contributing

Help us build this benchmark category! We're looking for:
- Representative test scenarios
- Real-world routing patterns
- Suggestions for libraries to include

## 📝 Notes

Router benchmarks require more complex setup including:
- React rendering context
- Navigation simulation
- Memory and performance profiling
- Realistic routing patterns

These are currently being developed and will be added in a future update.
